<font color='red'>主题词：坚持 insist</font>

  as is symbolically depicted in the figure above, in front of us, a child ,lovely as well  as cute, is standing and asking his father a question,wearing  chinese traditional custom.

  the porpose of drawing seems to remind everyone that insisting is important to go to victory,so indispensable is insisting that the subject ought to have been into the limelight.

  three key reasons,in my humble opinion,could account for my viewpoint. to begin with, for instance,my roommate,tom,was addicted to reading,which made him get more reading capacity,during that period,everyone of use really admired his reading capacity,what's more.an increasing of number of people are beginning to realize that insisting play a crucial role in victory, last but no least,if we faild to insist to do something,we could be confronted with an umpromising and fruitless future.

 generally speaking, by no means should we give up our efforts to insist to do sometging,on the surface,doing sth at intervals seems to be a sound solution,but when carefully weighing in the mind, we find that overcoming lazy is more reasonable and effective,in this way,hopefully,we may have a much wonderful future.

### 第2次（改正）

**注意 短语积累，注意时态语态**

1. insist on doing 而不是to do
2. 语态错误 忘记加s
3. 形容词顺序：       正确的较为完整的应该是：1、限定词；2、性质描绘形容词；3、大小，长短，高低形容词；4、形状形容词；5、年龄，新旧形容词；6、颜色形容词；7、国籍，地区，出处形容词；8、物质材料形容词；9、用途，类别形容词；10、动名词或者名词中心词。其次，限定词除了定冠词、不定冠词、these、this等指示代词外，还包括数量词；下面给你举个例子：A charming small round old brown chinese wooden writing table。
4. 注意是 every one of  不是everyone of

<font color='red'>重要的是,不要把主题词定的太大了,如果这里从坚持自我就更好切入</font>

 As is symbolically depicted in the figure above, in front of us stands a child, lovely as well as cute, wearing a traditional Chinese costume, with confusion in his mind, while his father, amiable as well as friendly, is encouraging him.  So indispensable is insisting that the subject ought to have been into the limelight. 

Three key reasons, in my humble opinion, could account for my viewpoint. To begin with, for instance, my roommate, Tom, was addicted to reading, which made him get more capacity. During that period, every one of us really admired his capacity, what's more. An increasing number of people are beginning to realize that insisting plays a crucial role in victory. Last but not least, if we failed to insist on doing something, we would be confronted with an unpromising and fruitless future. 

Generally speaking, by no means should we give up our efforts to insist on doing something. On the surface, doing something at intervals seems to be a sound solution, but when carefully weighing in the mind, we find that overcoming laziness is more reasonable and effective. In this way, hopefully, we may have a much wonderful future.
