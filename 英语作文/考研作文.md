# 结果

### 2011 大

As is symbolically depicted in the figure above, in front of us floats the ship where two boys are casting some junk into the lake. The lake, crying, is hurt by some junk. The drawing, undoubtedly, conveys the meaning that so indispensable is protection of the environment that subject ought to have been brought into the limelight.

Three reasons, in my humble opinion, could account for my viewpoint. To begin with, my roommate, Tom, often went to Huangshan mountain to clean some junk on Huangshan mountain, which gave him many achievements and a medal which was made by the local government of Huangshan mountain to compliment his help. During that period, every one of us really admired his goodness. What's more, an increasing number of people are beginning to recognize that protection of the environment plays a key role in social progress as important as the lighthouse, which makes a crucial difference in leading ships to the right way. Last but not least, if we failed to insist on protecting the environment, we would be confronted with an unpromising and fruitless future.

Generally speaking, by no means should we give up our efforts to pay attention to the environment. For one thing, mass media, such as radio, newspapers, and the Internet should appeal to people to protect the environment. For another thing, we should enhance children and adults' awareness of protection of the environment.

In this way, hopefully, we may have a much wonderful future.

### 2011 小

Dear Tom,

I am very glad to hear that you asked me some questions. I am writing this letter in order to offer several suggestions about movies which are very meaningful.

The reasons for my suggestions are as follows. In the first place, if I recommended some movies about society, 《Arcane》 would be the best movie in the world. In the second place, due to the Marxist of the movie, it is very important for you to know that workers are the greatest people in the world. In the third place, we are badly in need of enhancing our awareness of Marxists, which can help us recognize the world.

Please give me my best regards to your family.i look forward to hearing from you soon.

YOURS sincerely:

Liming
